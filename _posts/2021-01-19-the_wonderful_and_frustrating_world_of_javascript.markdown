If you were to ask 100 developers if they like using JavaScript I believe 90 of them would say it has potential, 5 of them would say they love it, and the other 5 would run away in terror. I find myself somewhere in the middle. 

Magic Library (my JS prjoect) has been by far the most time consuming project I have worked on during my time with the Flatiron School. The good news is all of that time forced me to examine my code in ways I hadn't before.

Using JavaScript as a frontend language gave me the freedom to follow the flow of my data more easily than vanilla HTML had before. Seeing where my data was flowing from gave a clearer picture when something would unexpectedly go wrong, which granted plenty of opportunities to learn and work out solutions to those problems. 

By utlizing my cohort-mates as well as solo-learning I feel confident that I have taken another large step forward on my path to becoming a professional Software Engineer.
