Building this CLI project was an experience I will never forget. When I set out to complete this project I never imagined the rollercoaster ride of the highs of cracking an error that had stumped me for two plus hours or the  lows of said error I would be in for. I had tried once before to complete this project in my first cohort but soon transfered my current one after realizing I was wofully unpreppared to tackle this endeavor. This time around I was ready. 

The first big challenge I faced was figuring out what the heck I was going to do for my project. Initially I had no clue what I was going to do. Then I began to think about what is something I would use in my actual life? I landed on something that I knew I would enjoy using. A program that allowed me to filter through the Player's Handbook for Dungeons and Dragons! Anyone that has ever tried to read through the PHB knows it can get a little overwhelming so I found a 5e D&D API and got to work. 

Utilizing the Learn material, being active on Slack and reaching out to friends was essential to my growth as a programmer and ultimately gave me the push I needed to complete this challenge.
