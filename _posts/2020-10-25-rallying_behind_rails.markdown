First things first... 

**I love Rails. **

Rails  allows you to do so many amazing things with only a few lines in your terminal it's basically magic. No more spending hours and hours meticulously writing out every line of code when I need something done (I'm looking at you SQL project). By learning how to use *rails g  " insert thing here"*   hours of leg work are cut down to mere minutes!

Ok, sometimes it still takes hours but that's usually caused by User error...

I'm User...

Anyway, taking advantage of all that Rails comes with helped me immensly while building my project MovieVoid. Error handling  and validation helped a ton with making my project feel like I was building something tangable. Dropping a few validation lines in my models opened up the ability to keep input fields from being entered blank and royally confusing the heck out of me! 

Another thing I love about Rails is how it handles Join tables. 

When join tables are used (in my case, User -<Reviews>- Movies) ActiveRecord picks up on the associations and allows us to call things like @user.reviews & @user.movies which makes for manipulating our data that much cleaner and easier. Be careful that your associations are correct before getting too far into your project unless you want to spend hours fantasizing about throwing your computer into the street and starting a new life as a beet farmer. (It's not worth it)  

There is still a ton I want to learn / practice when using Rails, but after this project I feel that much closer!
